## Description

The School of Computing Term Project Showcase <a href="https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/homepage/events">(STePs)</a> is one of the largest event, similar to Trade shows, aims to bring together and present selected student projects/products in the School of Computing (SoC) to facilitate independent peer learning, entrepreneurship and effective employment with modern flipped career-fair approach. In addition, STePS facilitates better assessment model through multi-party assessment of course projects. It's a festive yet serious class showcase, in which students present their projects in all aspects of computer science and information systems to the respective Faculty, Industry guests, Government agencies, Sponsors and Investors for grading, to connect with potential employers and to seek opportunities for further development of their work through collaboration with Industry and Investors. 

In AY20/21 Sem II, CS6101 Conversational Recommendation Systems attended 18th STePs.There are 26 students in 10 teams focus on recent research on the topics of Conversational Systems, Recommender Systems and their intersections.

**üèÜ 1st place, Team 07: Extending Neural Collaborative Filtering**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
Extending the Neural Collaborative Filtering Framework to improve model understanding and robustness. Using additional Convolutional layers, Pairwise Loss Function and Auxiliary Information Embedding to explore potential model improvements.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
In our project, we explore the potential extensions to the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) Framework to improve model understanding and robustness. Using additional Convolutional layers, Pairwise Loss Function and Auxiliary Information Embedding, we experiment with the MovieLens-1M dataset to attain better model performance on Hit Rate and NDCG metrics while attempting to improve model understanding through auxiliary embeddings.<BR/>

**ü•à 2nd place, Team 04: Causal Estimation for Conversational Recommender Systems**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
In this project, we study popularity bias in Recommender System (RecSys), Conversational Recsys, and their interplays.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
We discover (1) conversation can significantly mitigate popularity bias for traditional RecSys; (2) Conversation RecSys suffers from popularity bias itself. We propose a method to mitigate popularity bias in Conversational RecSys. Please refer to our poster for technical details. Our experiment is still WIP, we will update on this github repo: https://github.com/YisongMiao/cs6101 <BR/>

**ü•â 3rd place, Team 09: Beyond IGMC**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
We extend the state-of-the-art Inductive Graph Matrix Completion recommender system by introducing Graph Normalization and Layer Aggregation variants, and explore the models' potent transfer learning capabilities.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
In this project, we investigate how recent advances in Graph Neural Network models can impact and even improve the ability of the state-of-the-art Inductive Graph Matrix Completion (IGMC) recommender system to predict ratings in the setting of only having ratings of each user-item interaction. We show this through measuring the baseline model performance against the extensions using the RMSE scoring. 

The IGMC is able to perform inductive matrix completion without any reliance on side-information. This allows the model to be highly applicable in many recommender system settings. It is also able to successfully transfer learning to other datasets with completely different recommender tasks and user bases.
We contribute 2 main extensions to the model, in particular: Graph-Normalisation and Layer Aggregation alternatives. We also extended the model visualisation and conducted meso-analysis on training examples with the greatest contributions to RMSE values. Furthermore, we explore the transfer learning capabilities of these inductive models, and benchmark the results against external datasets.<BR/>

**Team 01: Explore Multiple Response Modalities of DialogWAE**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
This project is focusing on assessing and interpreting the GMM prior components in DialogWAE.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
Neural response generation is a typical task in NLP community. DialogWAE is a new approach for dialogue modeling and response generation, which achieves SOTA result on popular datasets. In this work, we focus on exploring the various modalities of the generated responses. To be specific, we propose to: 
‚Ä¢	Analyze how the number K of prior components influences the overall performance.
‚Ä¢	Explore what each prior component of the Gaussian mixture distribution captures when K > 3.<BR/>

**Team 03: Feedback-guided Preference Adaptation Network (FPAN)**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
Multi-round conversational recommender systems (CRS), which interact with users by asking questions about attributes and recommending items multiple times in one conversation.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
FPAN uses gating modules to adapt the user embedding and item-level feedback, according to attribute-level feedback. This project looks to improve the offline and online training of FPAN. It does this by conducting a survey into the effectiveness of GraphSAGE convolutions. And, by introducing a function to calculate user & item bias.<BR/>

**Team 05: Counterfactual Recommender**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
Relevance Matrix Factorization and Asymmetric Tri-training are employed to build a recommendation system. Its algorithm is evaluated by using Coat dataset to simulate a scenario that we have only ‚Äúbiased‚Äù observational data for model training while evaluating on ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù data.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
Implicit feedback is easy to collect and can be useful to build a recommendation system in online service. However, the feedback suffered from popularity bias because a user gives feedback to an item only if it is exposed. To build an unbiased recommendation system, counterfactual learning and meta learning approaches are applied to deal with such observational data.<BR/>

**Team 06: Diversifying Dialogue Generation with Non-Conversational Text**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
Implementation for the paper Diversifying Dialogue Generation with Non-Conversational Text on English.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
Traditional neural network-based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models strongly suffer from the low diversity problem when it comes to open domain dialogue generation. The authors aim to diversify the dialogue generation with non-conversational text corpus in Chinese language. We attempt to extend this work to conversational and non-conversational datasets in English Analysis on how filtering the non-conversational corpus based on topic affects the result (selected topics: Politics, Attitude & Emotion, Health).<BR/>

**Team 08: NN for Ad Recommendation**

üìñ Abstract <BR/>
The project extends the popular DeepFM neural network to better predict users' click-through-rate of advertisements.<BR/>

‚úçÔ∏è Description <BR/>
DeepFM is a popular click-through-rate (CTR) model developed by Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab. In this project, we modifies the original neural network structure for better CTR predictions. More specifically, we introduced pooling layers to better capture the higher order feature interactions and b. added a linear layer to assign weights to the constituent deep model and factorisation machine (FM) model when combining the outputs. Our experimental results show that both extensions are able to improve the accuracy of the original DeepFM model.<BR/>
