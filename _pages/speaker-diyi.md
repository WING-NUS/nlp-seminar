Title:
Natural Language Processing with Less Data and More Structures 
 
Abstract:
Recently, natural language processing (NLP) has had increasing success and produced extensive industrial applications. Despite being sufficient to enable these applications, current NLP systems often ignore the structures of language and heavily rely on massive labeled data.  In this talk, we take a closer look at the interplay between language structures and computational methods via two lines of work. The first one studies how to incorporate linguistically-informed relations between different training data to help both text classification and sequence labeling tasks when annotated data is limited. The second part demonstrates how various structures in conversations can be utilized to generate better dialog summaries for everyday interaction.
