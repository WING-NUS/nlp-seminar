Title: Conversations as Knowledge: from Attribute Extraction, Question Answering, to Summarization

Abstract: “Having conversations is one of the most common ways to share knowledge and exchange information. With the increase of remote working, people rely heavily on online communication tools such as emails (e.g., Gmail), panels (e.g., Zoom), and channels (e.g., Slack). In this talk, we will move beyond using conversational data to build chatbots and mainly focus on how can we leverage past conversations as a knowledge source for various downstream applications. We will cover three applications and their solutions as examples: 1) how to extract user attributes from conversations for life-long dialogue learning, 2) how to conduct question answering on conversations, and 3) how to generate a summary for conversations with controllable granularity.”
