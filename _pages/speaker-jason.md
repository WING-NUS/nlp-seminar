Title: Conversations as Knowledge: from Question Answering to Summarization

Abstract: Having conversations is one of the most common ways to share knowledge and exchange information. With the increase of remote working, people rely heavily on online communication tools such as emails (e.g., Gmail), panels (e.g., Zoom), and channels (e.g., Slack). In this talk, we will move beyond using conversational data to build chatbots and mainly focus on how can we leverage past conversations as a knowledge source for various downstream tasks. We will cover two applications and their solutions as examples: 1) how to conduct question answering on conversations and what's the challenge, and 3) how to generate a summary for conversations with controllable granularity and sketch supervision.
