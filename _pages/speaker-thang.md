## The curious case of self-training: from vision to language and beyond

In this talk, I will discuss the story of a classic semi-supervised learning approach, self-training, which has been quite successful lately. The talk starts first with NoisyStudent, a simple self-training method that has advanced state-of-the-art results on vision at the time and yielded surprising improvements on robustness benchmarks. I'll then transition to NLP to talk about STraTA, an approach that combines self-training and task augmentation to achieve strong results in few-shot NLP settings, where only a handful of training examples are available.
